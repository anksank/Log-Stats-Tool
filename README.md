# Log Statistics Tool
A Java Tool to find out occurrences of particular set of words in a text file. The tool is built in Java and can be mainly used to analyze log files. It can be used to find the number of times a user logs in, faces an error, logs out, etc. We just need to know the console text in each of such cases.  
The config.txt file contains the confiuguration through which the occurences are counted. Edit that file to search for your own custom text in the file.
